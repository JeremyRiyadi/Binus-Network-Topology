# Binus-University-Network-Topology

This project presents a **Cisco Packet Tracer network topology** designed for **Binus University**. The topology simulates how computers, switches, routers, and servers are interconnected within a campus environment.

## Project Overview
- **Type**: Group Project  
- **Objective**: To design and simulate a computer network for Binus University using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
- **Topology Description**:  
  - Multiple PCs are connected to switches in each classroom.  
  - Multiple switches are connected to routers.  
  - Several routers are connected to central servers.  

## Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer  

## Topology Features
- **Classroom Networks**: Each classroom contains several PCs connected to a switch.  
- **Switching**: Switches interconnect local PCs and provide access to routers.  
- **Routing**: Routers manage inter-network communication between different segments.  
- **Servers**: Central servers provide network services across the topology.
